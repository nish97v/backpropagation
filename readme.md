# Implementation of Backpropagation
- The goal of this project is to better understand the backpropagation and to implement the sigmoid function and the backpropagation for a multilayer perceptron with sigmoid activations.

## Environment
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Dataset
- Download MNIST dataset in this repository from [here](../data). Note that this has a different format as you used for the homework02, since we want to use the data loading functions in the code directly.
